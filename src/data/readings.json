If I worked, I'd have to get an evening job, say, in a bar or restaurant, because during the day, I have classes and lectures. So I'd probably go to bed late every night and just be tired all the time. I'd also miss out on my social life. Of course, I do need to earn some money to pay off my student loan, but I do that during the vacations. I don't go on holiday! And I don't mind if I leave university with quite a big dept. Hopefully, I'll earn a good salary and be able to pay it off."
